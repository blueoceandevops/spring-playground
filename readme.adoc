= Spring Playground

A collection of libraries that might be helpful when building Spring (Boot) applications.
Currently starring:

* https://github.com/modelmapper/modelmapper[Modelmapper] Spring Data integration -- enables the lookup of Spring Data repository managed aggregates from DTOs during object mapping.
Also contains Spring Boot auto-configuration.
* link:spring-web-tools[`spring-web-tools`] -- containing a monadic API to implement controller methods.
Also, helpers to serialize `Errors` instances as JSON easily.
* link:hotwire-spring-boot[Hotwire Spring Boot integration] -- API to conveniently create Turbo Stream representations from Spring MVC controllers.

More to come.
